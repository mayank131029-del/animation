                            <p>The Squash and Stretch technique is used by animators to convey an object's weight,
                                flexibility, and hardness. <br>
                                <br>
                                For example, when there is an animation of an object falling, it gets flattened when it
                                touches the ground and stretches out to maintain its volume. This shows that the object
                                is
                                flexible.<br>

                                Similarly, with characters, their faces and bodies are stretched and compressed to
                                express

                                movie.
                                Look at how Simba’s expressions are showcased using this technique when he tries a bug
